            <h1>Marvellous Ending</h1>
            <p>The message of this film is that there is no symmetry to life. What goes around does not come around. The fall of the coin has no bearing on the way the cookie crumbles. There is no right or wrong to the fates of men. No justice. Opportunities seized may lead on to fortune, but they could just as well lead on to dusty death. Only children expect things to be fair. As things once were they need no longer be. Now that IMDb has decided to list reviews by date there is a slightly increased possibility that this effort will be read by someone. Performance reviews are absolutely not read by me for helpfulness, but for interest and entertainment. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4078243/?ref_=tt_urv">For more information</a>.</p>

            <h1>How Much Violence Can You Handle</h1>
            <h2>Spoiler Warning</h2>
            <p>This film grabs you and doesn't let go. There is so much tension and so much pain and so much death. I can think of a more despicable villain in my movie viewing past. This is a stretch for me because I am really tired of gratuitous violence. The scenes here are so graphic and fast paced, deaths of innocents and perhaps, the deserving. I guess I should read the book for some insights. The grim reaper is around the corner and he has an air compressor not a scythe. I'm curious to see what other things Bardem has done. He is certainly a presence. Of all the scenes that will stay with me, the one at the hole in the wall gas station when the first coin is flipped is the most intense. There has been so much commentary. All I can say is it was like watching an accident; you can't take your eyes off it.<a href="https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2190489/?ref_=tt_urv">For more information</a></p>
